# Bussiness Simulator

The objective of this Business Simulator is to be able to know the complex interdependencies between the variables that are the object of the decisions and the variables that express the results.

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
